This idea behind this post is when I accidentally see this picture in the Facebook page is called "The fool"
<img src="/img/30_days_writting/writting_topic.jpg" class="no-max-width">
I decided to do a small challenge is that I will write continuously in 30 days with the topic is listing in this above picture.
So today's topic is: "List 10 things that make me really happy". Honestly, I found it is really hard to find that out, it is pretty easy if it was changed to
" List 10 things that you love"

### 1. I was born into this world
I don't know whether it is counted as a thing. But it is obviously nothing will happen if this thing won't happen. I was grateful because I was born,
I can sit here before the computer and write this post.

### 2. I have a great parent
I was born in a small village, my parents both father and mother are the farmer. I was the first child in my family when I was a kid, my life is not full as the life of my brother now but it's not too hard. My parent always cares about me, they looked after me when I got sick. Although don't have much money, but they send me to the town's school when I went to high school, and after that is the university. Above all, the meaningful thing is that I know they always there and love me unconditionally.

### 3. Breathe

We almost don't care simple thing we do every day simple as breath, maybe it too common to make you realize it. But recently, I got sick, and I evenly breath
normally, I'm sleepness overt the night, and I just wish that I could breath, happiness is simple, isn't it?

### 4. Books

I have a habit reading book in the university, after break up with my girl friend, I found to book as a cue to save me. You know, after break up, I feel sad, hurt
and I want to escape from that feeling, so I read a lot, and from know I it help me alot.

### 5. Running

Running or walking, I have time to think, in the difuse mode, not constrate in other, this feeling is pretty cool

### 6. Friends



### 7. Going somewhere

Sometime, traveling make I feel refresh, I like to know about the new place, know about new people. I prefer go to small, peace viligage rather than big, noisy
city

### 8. Living alone

As a introvert person, I like to spend almost of my time alone, and I love that. It make me feel safe and comfortable with, form outside of noisy world out there.

### 9. I'm lucky
Honestly, I'm not consider myself as a success person, I think I wasn't did thing as good as I could. Maybe I can worker harder, I can take more risk, I have do
what I'm suppose to do. I even has a list thing must to do, but I haven't done much of it, I pretty lazy, but I feel myself lucky. I have met good friends, good
teacher in university, I found the job that I really enjoy to do and I pay me enough for my life. I know it is enough and I have time to do whatever I want to do

## 10. ...
I realized that I can't come up with any more idea that satifisze, maybe happiness is too simple, I up to you, and it must start from inside of you.
